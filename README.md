# Android Kernel Compiling Project

This is a very new project which I have been doing quite recently as of the time I'm writing this.

This project is meant to make Android kernel compiling much easier by using GitHub workflows and thus without consuming any device resources for compiling.

This is still an early project and I'm still working on it, So feel free to give any possible issues. ;)

>Note: I can't say for sure whether it will work on Android GKI kernels, but as soon as I figure I will update this repo or might even create a new repo. This is mainly for non-GKI kernels (project is still not ready, don't expect anything to work now)
>I've mainly made this project so that users can compile their kernel to have native docker support and KVM support.

## Introduction

This uses the same idea as how an Android kernel is compiled.
This project just uses GitHub actions for kernel compiling making the kernel compiling completely online and also allowing users, who don't have a good for compiling, to compile their Android devices' kernel according to their wish.
>It also works for the Android kernels which can't be compiled on your Android device because of some issues.

## Important
**The project is not ready and is still under development, so don't expect that this repo would work even if you fork it. Further information will be provided when this repo receives any updates.**
